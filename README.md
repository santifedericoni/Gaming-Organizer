# Game Organizer

This is a joint project by [Santy](https://github.com/santifedericoni) and [Jason](https://github.com/jpark-dev), two recent graduates from the [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) Vancouver, BC, Canada. 

[Santy](https://github.com/santifedericoni) first came up with the idea and setup the initial project and Jason later joined to deliver the knowledge and skills they learned from the Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp.

## Current Progress
**Wk1**: We had 3 video meetings to share and discuss the general idea about the project. We then began planning DB using draw.io to understand what kind of data we actually want to store to successfully render the application and necessary features. We have agreed to have morning meetup to discuss daily progress and share ideas.

**(Current) Wk2**: Wrote user stories to fix the exact features to be implemented in our project, discussed how to build them with limitations. Continued working on basic features.


## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminals for this.

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
